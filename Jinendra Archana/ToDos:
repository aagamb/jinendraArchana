1. (Done) FavoritesView:
    - The favorited books are not being loaded up when the favorites tab is opened, allowing for the same book to be selected multiple times.
2. (Done) Search:
    - When opening a book after searching for it, we get two back buttons, one called "Jinendra Archana", and the second called "Book List". There should only be one back button.
